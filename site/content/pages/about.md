##Migration and Segregation in Three Dimensional Cellular Co-cultures

This website is dedicated to keeping track of data and results produced for 
my Capstone project. Most content is automatically generated by my experimental
simulations and programs and consists of data sets, figures, run parameters, 
as well as qualitative observations and notes. In a sense, this is an online
lab book.


BCIM is a brownian colloid simulator being developed to study cancer cell
mechanics.

BCIM utilizes several open source technologies:

[Julia](http://julialang.org/) - Julia is a high performance, scientific
programming language currently in development. BCIM relies on Julia for the
bulk of its simulation work.

[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is a python library for
generating figures. BCIM uses matplotlib to generate figures in postprocessing.

[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) - Pelican is a static site generator
written in python. This site and the lab book pages are generated using
pelican.
